										How to Use
Summary

	- Upon application start, the game begins in "Attract mode" which is essentially a main menu splash screen. 

	- Players can start and enter the game mode in which the starship, asteroids, and a bullet will render.

	- The playership renders in center of screen and moves according to inputs from an Xbox controller and/or a keyboard 	  		as specified below.

	- Asteroids spawn, rotate, and move randomly.

	- The bullet renders in center of screen facing east and will travel east VERY SLOWLY when fired

	- There is no collision functionality between entities.

	- Application quits process
		
		- exit game mode, then attract mode, then back to windows.


In Attract Mode
	Quit Game (Exit application)
	- Keyboard Keycode 'ESC'

In game mode
	Game Pause (Sound plays when pause is pressed)
	- Xbox BUTTON_Start
	- Keyboard Keycode 'P'

	Thruster (move starship foward)
	- Xbox RIGHT_TRIGGER
	- Keyboard Keycode 'E'

	Rotate starship
	- Xbox LEFT_JOYSTICK rotates in direction of analog
	- Keyboard Keycode 'S' rotates left
	- Keyboard Keycode 'F' rotates right

	Thruster (move starship foward)
	- Xbox RIGHT_TRIGGER press
	- Keyboard Keycode 'E'

	Fire Bullet (*Note - current bullet is rendered facing east and will travel east VERY SLOWLY when fired)
	- Keyboard Keycode 'SPACEBAR' 

	Respawn
	- Xbox BUTTON_Y
	- Keyboard Keycode 'N'	

	Quit Game mode (return to Attract Mode)
	- Keyboard Keycode 'ESC'

										Known Issues
1. The game is incomplete.
	a. My latest progress stopped at halfway through assignment 2.

2. Collision is NOT implemented.

3. World boundaries do NOT exist.

4. A bullet is rendered on screen in world center on game mode start.

5. Fire bullet doesn't fire out of the. 


										Deep Learning

The biggest improvement I have seen in myself as a programmer thus far has been learning how to think. The way my brain interprets code has transitioned from autopilot to being more intentional and systematic with the questions I ask myself as well as the actions I take. 

At the beginning of the semester, I struggled with thinking before acting. I had a tendency to immediately start writing code and stumbling my way through the assignment with a shallow understanding of the issue or goal I was trying to achieve. Oftentimes, I was unable to figure out what I was doing wrong, leaving me unproductive and inefficient with bad code. 

As I worked on Starship, attended your office hours, and got help from the GAs/peers, I started to recognize the differences between my approach and a programmer’s “ideal” approach to thinking about code. I realized that when reading code, I just interpreted the syntax at face value without seeing the larger picture. I couldn’t understand its function, its meaning/message, why it exists, and how it connected to other parts of the program. As a result, I couldn’t solve problems because I was just trying to write the correct line of code as fast as I could without visualizing the answer. 

In order to overcome this weakness, I want to improve my ability to deconstruct concepts and ask better questions. Throughout the assignment, I resisted the urge to start typing without thinking and tried to actually understand the functions by drawing them on paper or discussing what its architecture should be with my peers. This helped me visually process the solution, question core ideas, and clarify what line(s) of code I needed to write. Thus, establishing a good practice I need to follow in order to improve my programming instincts.

As I develop this intuition over time through practice and exposure to more experienced programmers, I want to continue on this growth trajectory over the next two years and eventually within the industry. I want to keep learning how to think and absorbing as much knowledge and information as I can to develop my programming framework and tools. I believe doing so will put me in a better position to become fluent in C++ and write good code in the future.
